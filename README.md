## About ##

In this repository you will find implementations of various algorithms I have studied as part of my doctoral research into path-finding. This includes Jump Point Search and Rectangular Symmetry Reduction.

My development platform is Linux 20.04with most of the code here being written in C++. When compiling I recommend that platform together with GCC 9.3.0. In the past I have successfully compiled and executed the same code on OSX (most recently macOS 10.13).
