## About ##

You have reached Daniel Harabor's Code Repository. If you would like to know about me or my work (or if are simply looking for copies of published papers) please visit my [homepage](http://harabor.net/daniel).

Among other things, this repository hosts the Warthog Pathfinding Library. Warthog is a collection of shortest-path algorithms I have developed as part of my research at [NICTA](http://www.nicta.com.au) and elsewhere. Included are some efficient implementations of the methods known as Jump Point Search and JPS+.  Warthog is written in C++ and has been built by me from the ground up. It is named for (and at one time based on) Nathan Sturtevant's open-source library [Hierarchical Open Graph](http://hog2.googlecode.com). 

My development environment is OSX 10.8.4. As such the code is best compiled on that platform using GCC 4.8.1. From time to time I have successfully compiled and executed Warthog on Ubuntu 13.10. 

The current "release" is tagged [apr2016](https://bitbucket.org/dharabor/pathfinding/commits/tag/apr2016).

Warthog is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL Version 2. I make it available in the interest of scientific research and without any guarantees.
